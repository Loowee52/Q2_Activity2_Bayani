		<p class="p1"; align="center">Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
		And sorry I could not travel both<br>
		And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
		And looked down one as far as I could<br>
		To where it bent in the undergrowth;</p>

		<p id="Para2"; align="center">Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
		And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
		Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
		Though as for that the passing there<br>
		Had worn them really about the same,</p>

		<p align="center">And both that morning equally lay<br>
		In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
		Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
		Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
		I doubted if I should ever come back.</p>

		<p align="center">I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
		Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
		Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”<br>
		I took the one less traveled by,<br>
		And that has made all the difference.</p>
